I am stdying my PHD in Computer Sience at the Faculty of Science and Engineering, [Department of Computing](https://www.mq.edu.au/about/about-the-university/faculties-and-departments/faculty-of-science-and-engineering/departments-and-centres/department-of-computing) at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia.


My PHD project is supervised by [Dr. Len Hamey](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/len-hamey), [Prof. Dali Kaafar](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/dali-kaafar), and [Dr. Dinusha Vatsalan](https://research.csiro.au/isp/about-us/people/dinusha-vatsalan/) and is titled: "Machine Learning for Malware Detection in Adversairial Settings". We study attack and defense methods for adversarial malware detection with a direct focus on machine learning-based models for crafting adversarial sample. My primary research interests are Machine Learning applications in Data Security and Privacy, Big Data and Block-Chain.

Before starting my PHD at Macquarie University, I was a member of R&D team at Tehran Municipality ICT organization in Tehran, Iran.
