I am PHD stdudent stdying Computer Sience in MQ Computing Department at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia.


My PHD project is supervised by [Dr. Len Hamey](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/len-hamey), [Prof. Dali Kaafar](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/dali-kaafar), and [Dr. Dinusha Vatsalan](https://research.csiro.au/isp/about-us/people/dinusha-vatsalan/) and is titled: "Machine learning for Malware Detection in Adversairial Settings". We study attack and defense methods for adversarial malware detection with a direct focus on machine learning-based models for crafting adversarial sample. My primary research interests are Machine learning applications in Data Security and Privacy, Big Data and Block-Chain.

Before starting my PHD at Macquarie University, I was a member of R&D team at Tehran Municipality ICT organization in Tehra, Iran. in founder and group leader of the Information Security and Privacy group at CSIRO Data61, a principal researcher at National ICT Australia (NICTA) and a permament researcher at the Privatics team at INRIA in France.
